Want to get started on your hackathon project but not sure where to start?  
Learn the basics of building a basic end to end web application using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Python Flask!

# Setup: 
NOTE: WE ARE STILL IN PROGRESS OF UPDATING THE REPOSITORY! So please wait to clone it, thank you!

- Clone this repository. The main branch is a starter template we created with various TODO comments that we will be covering during the workshop.
- Install the following libraries in Python by using pip in the command line of the project's directory. If you do not have pip installed, please see the following link for more help (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):
    - Navigate to the hackuci2021-web-dev-workshop directory you just cloned, and run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all dependencies.
    - OR you can manually install each one: 
        - Flask: ```pip install flask```
 - If you're having issues with imports or cloning, feel free to fork this Repl.it project which has the same starter template
    - It should automatically import everything you will need
    - You must create a Repl.it account with Google and fork the project
